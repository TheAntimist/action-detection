#+TITLE: Action Detection

* What is this?
This repository if for classifying videos/sequences containing actions, and classifying them. This is written in Python 3.

Currently we utilize the KTH dataset, which can be found here: [[http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/]]along with that, for the interest points we utilize the Spatio-Temporal Interest Points as defined by Laptev et al., which can be found here: [[https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/download/stip-2.0-linux.zip]]

Note: Regarding STIP, to work correctly with the current OpenCV, a workaround has to be made to link the correct libs.
* Installing
This module uses scikit-learn, which can be installed by either the
: pip install -r requirements.txt
or 
: pip install sklearn
* Executing
For now, to execute
: python3 prepare_data.py
